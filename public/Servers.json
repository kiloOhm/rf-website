Create and defend your borders and welcome citizens. Engage in economics, taxation, exploration or religion. Spark diplomacy and peace or hostilities. Even attempt to conquer the world if you dare, but you will certainly need help.\n All actions are determined by real players, like you, and thus you will find a great deal of allegory in attempts to have large sweeping impacts on the island (be sure to make yourself well familiar with the server rules of engagement and respectful conduct between factions).\n We are about the stories that lead to cooperation or conflict. Everyone wants to leave their mark, and that starts with how you inspire the minds of those around you. How will you do it?\n If you feel like you need inspiration on how to begin, join our discord at discord.gg/xHCVhuq!\n Thank you for joining us!",
