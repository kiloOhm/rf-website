1. Disclaimer
1.1. Resolutions and punishments are managed on a case-by-case basis, by the staff member responsible for dealing with the incident. The staff team has a zero tolerance policy to personal abuse - against themselves, or any other team member. We do not accept any excuses for this form of behavior. If you are unsatisfied with the resolution - you are welcome to challenge the decision by contacting the senior team through the ban-appeals ticket on discord. Persistent offenders, constantly (and unsuccessfully) challenging decisions, as well as causing issues for the server, are more likely to be permanently banned for being a persistent nuisance. The staff team have a limited amount of time available to deal with a large amount of requests - anyone who is a persistent drain on this limited resource is directly impacting the server, and so will be removed.
