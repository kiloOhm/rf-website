Roleplay

Welcome to Rust Factions Roleplay!
This server was built to inject group collaboration, borders and politics into the world of Rust, requiring interactions and diplomacy between groups as prelude to hostilities or conflict.
We have a long and fascinating history, all created by unique and clever players like you.
Choose your friends, faction, alliances and enemies. Create and defend your borders and welcome citizens. Engage in economics, taxation, exploration or religion. Spark diplomacy and peace or hostilities. Even attempt to conquer the world if you dare, but you will certainly need help.
All actions are determined by real players, like you, and thus you will find a great deal of allegory in attempts to have large sweeping impacts on the island (be sure to make yourself well familiar with the server rules of engagement and respectful conduct between factions).
We are about the stories that lead to cooperation or conflict. Everyone wants to leave their mark, and that starts with how you inspire the minds of those around you. How will you do it?
If you feel like you need inspiration on how to begin, join our discord at discord.gg/xHCVhuq!
Thank you for joining us!

Welcome to Rust Factions Vanilla!
Sick of being off-lined? Our plugins provide offline-raid protection and much more organised conflict.
Invite your friends, form a faction and make alliances. Claim your territory and defend it. Spark diplomacy and peace or conquer the world if you dare.
Everyone wants to leave their mark, and that starts with you. How will you do it?
